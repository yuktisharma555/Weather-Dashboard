# Weather-Dashboard
📖 <u>**Project Summary**</u>

The Weather Dashboard is a lightweight, professional, and interactive web application built with Vue.js and TailwindCSS. It allows users to search for a city and instantly view weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions. The project is designed as a showcase of modern frontend development practices, balancing both visual appeal and practical functionality. Currently, it runs on mock data for demonstration purposes, but it can be easily integrated with a real weather API like OpenWeatherMap.

⭐ **Core Features**

🌍 City Search → Enter any city name to get weather details.
🌤 Weather Card Display → Shows temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed.
📱 Responsive UI → Fully styled with TailwindCSS for a professional look on all devices.
🔄 Vue Reactivity → Instant updates to the interface when new data is entered.
🎭 Mock Data Support → Works out-of-the-box without needing API keys.

🛠 **Technology Used**

Vue.js 3 → For reactive UI components and state handling.
TailwindCSS → For clean, utility-first, responsive design.
HTML5 + CSS3 → Core web structure and styling.
JavaScript (ES6+) → Business logic and event handling.

📌 <u>**Current Progress**</u>

✅ Functional search input and reactive weather display.
✅ Professional UI design using Tailwind components.
✅ Mock weather data integration for quick demo setup.
⏳ Real API connection planned (currently in mock mode).

📚 **What I Learned**

Through building this project, I gained experience in:
Structuring a Vue.js app with reactive state and methods.
Handling form inputs and conditional rendering effectively.
Applying TailwindCSS utilities to design modern and responsive layouts.
Designing a project that balances formal presentation with creative functionality.
